## [v0.2.0] - 2024-11-20
### Fix
- RCC entrypoint: build every environment with ROBOCORP_HOME read from .env. After that, export the environment into ZIP files, and import them into the shared holotree. Only in this way the holotree paths are user-definable.
- fixed bug in certificate generation (SERVER:NAME not exported)

### Refactor
- added volumes to containers
- moved the robots

### Style
- added better logging


<a name="v0.1.0"></a>
## v0.1.0 - 2024-11-20
### OK
- self-signed and signed certificates work
